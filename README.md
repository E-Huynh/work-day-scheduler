## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create an online app that a user could use to track their daily tasks throughout the day. It consists of hour blocks between 9am-5pm, with an input where users can jot down their daily to-do list and save them. The information saved will automatically repopulate when the user visits the page again.
The time blocks also color code themselves to whether the hour has pass, is present, or is in the future.
## Functionality
Users are able to store any appointments or list in any of the 1 hour blocks throughout the day. The notes will be saved to local storage when clicking the save icon. The hour blocks are automatically color coded by past, present, and future time blocks for convienence.
## Instructions
